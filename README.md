# Audio Player

A responsive React audio player built for high-resolution waveform exploration, artwork-driven navigation, and rich release and track metadata.

The player is one component of a broader record-label media workflow, but this repository is intentionally focused on the **public-facing playback experience**. Metadata authoring, private-library administration, and deployment tooling belong outside the player.

## Highlights

- Custom audio playback with reliable play, pause, resume, restart, previous, and next behavior
- Scrolling Canvas waveform with a fixed center playhead
- Frequency-aware waveform rendering with multiple color modes
- Waveform zoom from broad track overview to sample-level oscilloscope views
- Mouse, touch, drag, swipe, double-click, and double-tap interactions
- Stacked artwork navigation with previous and next release context
- Responsive music library for desktop, mobile portrait, and mobile landscape
- Release and track metadata viewer with multiple levels of detail
- Metadata-editor publication-package consumption through `/media/*`
- HLS playback with hls.js plus native-HLS fallback
- Persistent site-wide playback with release-scoped queues and a compact global transport
- macOS development with Debian 13 compatibility as a target

## Technology

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Web Audio API
- HTML5 Audio
- hls.js / Media Source Extensions
- Canvas 2D API
- Custom Canvas waveform and oscilloscope rendering
- Sanitized JSON release/track publication metadata

## Playback

The player supports:

- Play, pause, resume, and restart
- Previous and next track navigation
- Direct track selection from the library
- Row-level play and pause controls
- Double-click or double-tap to play or restart a track
- Playback-state preservation when navigating between adjacent tracks
- Mobile-safe track loading inside user gestures to preserve autoplay permission
- Library browsing without interrupting the currently loaded track
- Release-page playback without route changes
- Release-scoped queues with automatic advancement through the remaining tracks
- Compact site-wide now-playing controls that expand into the full `/listen` player

## Persistent playback and queue

Hiplingo mounts one `AudioPlayer` for the lifetime of the public application
shell. Routing changes presentation only; they do not unmount the underlying
HTML audio element, HLS instance, or Web Audio graph.

Release pages send playback commands directly to that persistent player:

```text
/release detail
      |
      | play track / play release
      v
persistent AudioPlayer
      |
      +-- release-scoped queue
      +-- HLS playback
      +-- compact global transport off /listen
      `-- expanded interface on /listen
```

Selecting an individual track starts it immediately and keeps the playable
tracks from that release as the active queue. Next/previous stay inside the
queue, and reaching the end of a track automatically advances when another
queued track remains. The final queued track stops normally.

`/listen` is therefore an expanded view of the same playback session rather
than a separate player lifecycle.

## Artwork Navigation

Artwork is treated as a primary navigation surface rather than a passive thumbnail.

- Previous, current, next, and second-neighbor artwork can appear in a stacked layout
- Horizontal swiping changes tracks
- Previous and next buttons provide an accessible alternative to gestures
- Drag resistance, direction detection, gesture reversal, and commit thresholds reduce accidental navigation
- Stable handoff and commit overlays prevent flicker during artwork transitions
- Swipe-generated clicks are suppressed
- Artwork and controls resize for desktop, mobile portrait, and mobile landscape

Artwork resolves in this order:

1. Track-specific artwork
2. Release front artwork
3. No artwork

The player safely supports catalog entries where `artwork` is `null`.

## Waveform

The waveform is rendered with a custom Canvas pipeline.

- Fixed center playhead
- Smooth `requestAnimationFrame` scrolling
- Mouse and touch scrubbing
- Pointer capture for stable drag behavior
- Playback pauses during scrubbing and resumes only when appropriate
- Long-press context menus and mobile double-tap zoom are suppressed in the interaction area
- Enlarged current-time overlay
- Zoom range from `2 px/s` through `6400 px/s`

Available waveform color modes:

- 3-Band
- RGB
- Blue
- Monochrome

## Waveform Analysis

Waveform data is generated ahead of playback and stored as JSON.

Each peak contains:

```text
[min, max, low, mid, high]
```

Where:

- `min` is the minimum waveform amplitude
- `max` is the maximum waveform amplitude
- `low` is low-frequency energy
- `mid` is mid-frequency energy
- `high` is high-frequency energy

Current analysis settings:

- Schema version: 2
- Storage: `waveform-peaks.wfp` compact binary format v1
- Peak record: 10 bytes — signed Int16 `min`/`max`, unsigned 16-bit `low`/`mid`/`high`
- Peaks per second: 400
- FFT size: 1024
- Window: Hann
- Low band: 20–250 Hz
- Mid band: 250–4000 Hz
- High band: 4000–20000 Hz
- Per-band normalization using the 95th percentile
- Square-root compression

Audio duration and waveform timing have been validated across the supported zoom levels.

## Oscilloscope

Zooming beyond the maximum waveform scale transitions into an oscilloscope view.

- Multiple magnification stages use progressively smaller sample windows
- Plus and minus controls move between waveform and oscilloscope modes
- Live Web Audio analyser integration
- Hold and freeze interactions for inspecting the signal
- Stable panel dimensions during mode changes
- Short visual transition between waveform and oscilloscope views

## Music Library

The library is designed to remain useful across screen sizes without replacing the player.

- Full-width desktop library beneath the player
- Dedicated mobile library sheet
- View all tracks or filter by release
- Single-tap highlights a track without interrupting playback
- Double-click or double-tap plays or restarts a track
- Separate row-level play and pause controls
- Full square artwork thumbnails beside circular transport controls
- Independently scrolling release and track regions
- Backdrop taps close the mobile library without activating controls underneath

Responsive behavior:

### Mobile portrait

- Compact controls and centered artwork
- Full-width library launcher
- Stacked release and track sections
- Independent scrolling
- Touch-friendly controls and safe-area spacing

### Mobile landscape

- Artwork in a compact left rail
- Controls and waveform on the right
- Side-by-side release and track columns
- Reduced waveform height on short displays

### Desktop

- Artwork and waveform arranged side by side
- Library spans the layout beneath the player
- Expanded metadata columns
- Compact vertical spacing

## Metadata Viewer

The player can display release, track, credits, production, technical-analysis, waveform, and warning information.

Available views include:

- Summary
- Detailed
- Audiophile
- Developer

Metadata provenance indicators distinguish values that are:

- Manually authored
- Generated
- Inherited
- Fallback values
- Missing
- Track-level
- Release-level
- Derived from directory names

Developer Mode is hidden during normal use and can be revealed through the About interaction.

## Shared brand assets

The canonical Hiplingo logo source is owned once by the shared package:

```text
../packages/brand/src/hiplingo-logo.png
```

`@hiplingo/brand` exports `hiplingoLogoUrl`. Hiplingo and the sibling
metadata-editor consume that same source, so replacing one file and rebuilding
both applications updates their branding and neutral no-artwork fallbacks.

Site-specific background textures remain under:

```text
public/brand/
├── hiplingo-banner-mobile.webp
└── hiplingo-banner-desktop.webp
```

The shared logo is application chrome, not release or Artist media. A missing
artwork slot may display it without claiming that logo as authored artwork.

## Published-media contract

Hiplingo is a **read-only consumer** of publication packages produced by
`metadata-editor`. The player does not author, transcode, sanitize, or publish
public media.

The default development media root is the public-safe sibling directory:

```text
../published-media
```

Vite maps that directory to the same URL contract used in production:

```text
/media/catalog.json
/media/releases/<release-id>/release.json
/media/releases/<release-id>/tracks/<track-id>/track.json
/media/releases/<release-id>/tracks/<track-id>/stream/index.m3u8
/media/releases/<release-id>/tracks/<track-id>/waveform-peaks.wfp
```

`catalog.json` is intentionally small. Hiplingo follows each catalog
`release.href`, then each release `track.href`. `track.json` supplies relative
`stream.href`, `waveform.href`, and artwork references.

The catalog adapter in `src/lib/mediaCatalog.ts` temporarily also recognizes
the older audio-player catalog shape so a previously overwritten
`published-media/catalog.json` can still be used to discover release IDs.
`release.json` and `track.json` remain authoritative in both cases.

For temporary testing only, an alternate read-only root can be selected:

```sh
PUBLISHED_MEDIA_ROOT=../some-public-package npm run dev
```

### Publication ownership

`metadata-editor` owns:

- HLS/AAC derivative generation
- Browser-compatible artwork derivatives
- Waveform generation
- Sanitized public release and track JSON
- Publication manifests
- `published-media/catalog.json`
- Atomic package promotion/update

Hiplingo owns:

- Catalog/package consumption
- Release and track browsing
- Artwork and waveform presentation
- HLS playback
- Playback state and public-site UI

Producer-side media preparation scripts have been removed from this repository.
The Hiplingo public app has no supported workflow that writes to `published-media`.
Publication changes must originate from `metadata-editor`.

## Shared media-player source

The sibling `../packages/media-player/` package is the canonical source for player behavior shared by the Hiplingo public app and metadata-editor. The package now owns the complete full-size visualization surface: fixed-center scrolling/audible scrubbing, the 2–6400 px/s zoom ladder, transition into the 2048–128-sample oscilloscope, hold-to-freeze inspection, cached per-track frames, optional zoom readout, and the reusable Web Audio media/analyser adapter. It also owns the compact whole-track seekable waveform, canonical 3Band/RGB/Blue/Monochrome color vocabulary, SVG transport icons, player-facing time formatting, Spacebar transport contract, compact Now Playing presentation shell, the speaker-button/vertical 0–100 volume interaction and perceptual volume curve, queue-neutral transport-controller helpers, and the host-neutral playable-media item shape.

The package deliberately does **not** own the persistent audio element, playback queue state, HLS/catalog loading, private Library APIs, metadata editing, publication, or deployment. Hiplingo keeps its public HLS/catalog source adapter; metadata-editor keeps its private application-shell preview/source adapter. Both hosts now attach their persistent HTML audio element to the same shared analyser lifecycle and render the same visualization surface and compact transport/volume shell while supplying source descriptors, waveform data, playback state, queue state, navigation, and host-specific actions. This keeps one player interaction implementation without allowing the public app to depend on the private Library.

metadata-editor and this repository both consume the same sibling package through `file:../packages/media-player`. Future player primitives should move into this package only when both hosts can use the same interface without host-specific filesystem or network assumptions.

## Project Scope

This repository is the Hiplingo public web application only.

`metadata-editor` owns metadata editing, private-library management, validation,
derivative preparation, and publication. Hiplingo consumes the resulting
`published-media` tree without exposing administrative write access or carrying
a second media-generation pipeline.

## Status

Current application version: **0.0.2**

Implemented milestones include playback, responsive artwork navigation, waveform and oscilloscope visualization, mobile and desktop library browsing, metadata views, release discovery, metadata-editor publication-package consumption, and persistent site-wide release-queue playback.

## License

This repository is publicly viewable for evaluation and portfolio review.
It is not open-source software. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for permitted use.

## Hiplingo web application shell

The public player now runs inside the mobile-first Hiplingo application shell.
The first shell milestone adds lightweight client-side routes without changing
the established playback engine:

```text
/
/listen
/releases
/artists
/licensing
/licensing/inquiry
/licensing/jam
/about
```

`/listen` hosts the existing AudioPlayer. Releases and Artists consume the
sanitized Web Package. Journal is intentionally not part of Hiplingo for now;
that writing will live on nathanbrenton.com. Licensing is the public rights-and-permissions entry point.
`/licensing/inquiry` is reserved for general music-licensing requests and
`/licensing/jam` for the streamlined Jam participant agreement workflow.

The private `licensing` application remains a separate administrative
application. Public licensing and Jam-participant experiences must talk only
to purpose-built restricted API surfaces and must not expose the
administrative UI or its unrestricted rights-management endpoints.

### Static hosting requirement

Production hosting must serve `index.html` as the fallback for application
routes such as `/listen` and `/artists`. Media remains separately addressable
through the publication/deployment contract rather than being bundled into the
frontend source tree.

## H2 release discovery

The public `/releases` route uses the hydrated metadata-editor publication
contract and presents an artwork-first release catalog. Release detail routes
use the stable release identifier:

```text
/releases/<release-id>
```

Each release page presents public release metadata and its track list. Playable
tracks command the single persistent player in place; selecting a track does
not require navigating to `/listen`. The full `/listen` route is the expanded
presentation of that same playback session.

The Hiplingo shell owns catalog loading and passes that catalog into
`AudioPlayer`. `AudioPlayer` still retains a standalone catalog-loading fallback
for reuse outside the shell. Shared catalog hydration, relative-resource resolution, artwork, artist, and
identity handling lives in `src/lib/mediaCatalog.ts`, keeping the publication
contract isolated from the player UI.


## H6 unified listening shell

Hiplingo uses one global application header. The legacy player-specific header
was removed from `/listen`; the site header now owns primary navigation,
`Browse Library`, and the player-settings menu. Short mobile-landscape layouts
use the same single compact header row.

`Browse Library` opens without changing routes. On desktop it presents as a
right-side drawer; on mobile it remains a bottom/full-height sheet. Selecting a
track from the browser establishes a queue from that release and begins
playback while the current page remains in place.

The global Now Playing dock remains interactive above library and metadata
overlays. Metadata dialogs no longer render a second mini-player, and the
library header no longer duplicates playback controls. The player-settings
overlay intentionally retains its compact waveform preview and play/pause
control because waveform appearance is edited there.

Track Metadata places its primary `Overview`, `Credits`, and `Track Info` tabs
in the modal title bar. Credits group `Recording & Editing` together and combine
`Mixing & Mastering` into one production card.

## H6.1 desktop library workspace

Desktop `Browse Library` uses a wide two-pane listening workspace instead of
reusing the compact artwork-wall browser. A dense release navigator occupies
the left pane; the right pane presents the selected release, release-level
playback, and its playable track list. `Releases` and `Tracks` modes plus local
search provide fast catalog access without leaving the current Hiplingo route.

The routed `/releases` experience remains the artwork-forward public discovery
surface. Browse Library remains the playback utility overlay. Mobile portrait
and landscape continue using the existing compact sheet/browser presentation.

Shared player visualization owns fixed-center audible scrubbing, the 2–6400 px/s waveform zoom ladder, the 2048–128-sample oscilloscope stages, hold-to-freeze inspection, cached per-track oscilloscope frames, optional Audiophile zoom readout, and the reusable media/analyser graph lifecycle; Hiplingo still owns HLS/public source attachment and catalog navigation.

The compact Now Playing shell now receives one shared `PlaybackShellController` for transport and volume. Both Hiplingo and metadata-editor also use shared `useMediaElementVolume()` state and perceptual gain application; host-specific source attachment remains outside the package.

Persistent media timeline state is now shared through `useMediaElementTimeline()`: current time, finite-duration normalization, direct seeking, and the shared waveform redraw notification live in `@hiplingo/media-player`, while Hiplingo keeps HLS/source and playback-event policy.

Persistent play/pause/loading state now comes from shared `useMediaElementPlaybackState()`. Hiplingo still owns scrub-aware media event reconciliation, ended behavior, and HLS source policy, so this step changes state ownership without changing playback semantics.

Ordinary HTML-media event transitions now use shared `useMediaElementPlaybackEvents()`: play/playing, pause, waiting, canplay, abort, error, and emptied update the common persistent playback state. Hiplingo still owns HLS/source policy, scrub/seek reconciliation, and ended/queue behavior.

Playback source attachment now crosses the shared `MediaSourceAdapter<TSource>` contract. Hiplingo's adapter implementation remains local to `AudioPlayer`: it still owns native HLS detection, lazy `hls.js` loading, fatal stream errors, autoplay-after-manifest behavior, and HLS teardown.

Source attachment is now orchestrated by shared `useMediaSourceSession()`: the session supplies the persistent audio element to Hiplingo's local adapter, tracks the current media key, suppresses stale async HLS completion, and centralizes adapter disposal. HLS/native-HLS behavior itself remains Hiplingo-owned.

The persistent HTML audio element itself now uses shared `usePersistentMediaElement()` ownership and the shared `PersistentMediaElement` renderer. Hiplingo still supplies its event policy and HLS source adapter, but the element reference consumed by timeline, volume, analyser, playback-state, and source-session hooks is created through the common player package.

## PT5 first-class published Artists

Hiplingo reads Artist identity and imagery from metadata-editor's sanitized
published Artist snapshot:

```text
/media/artists.json
/media/artists/<slug>/artist.json
/media/artists/<slug>/assets/<asset-id>.webp
```

Artist publication membership is not reconstructed from display names.
Release-to-Artist association uses the stable `release.primary_artist.id`
stored in sanitized release metadata and matches that ID to `artists.json`.

Release artwork remains release artwork. Artist cards and Artist identity views
use authored Artist photos. The Hiplingo mark is only neutral UI fallback when
no authored Artist photo is present.

## Public bios and release descriptions

Hiplingo treats short public text as authored canonical metadata.

- Artist bio: `artist.toml` → `artist.bio` → published `artist.json.bio`.
- Release description: `release.toml` → `release.description` → published
  `release.json.metadata.description`.

Artist bios appear on Artist detail pages. Release descriptions appear on
Release detail pages. Missing text is valid and simply leaves the section
hidden.

Journal is intentionally absent from Hiplingo for now. Journal-style work
will live on nathanbrenton.com later. Licensing is the public umbrella for
general rights inquiries and Jam participant agreements.

## Shared listener metadata viewer

Hiplingo's Track information modal delegates to the shared
`@hiplingo/media-player` listener metadata viewer. Metadata-editor consumes the
same presentation component for its public-style Library preview so tab order,
credit grouping, labels, and listener-facing layout remain synchronized.

## M1.19 native public agreement signer

`hiplingo.com` now owns the public signing surface at `/sign/<opaque-token>`. The route is intercepted before the normal listener application mounts, so a legal-signing session does not initialize the persistent audio player, catalog UI, or private Rights Console.

The public signer uses only the deliberately anonymous Rights API surface under `/api/public/signer/...`. In local Vite development, `VITE_RIGHTS_API_BASE_URL` may override the API origin; otherwise development targets `http://127.0.0.1:4175/api` and production uses same-origin `/api`. No administrator or mothership-sync credential belongs in the public frontend bundle.

The signer is mobile-first and dark by default. Purple is the default appearance, with Gray and Blue alternatives. `?theme=purple`, `?theme=gray`/`grey`, and `?theme=blue` are supported; the selection is remembered locally under the shared `hiplingo-theme` key. The signer continues to mirror the legacy local Rights-signer key during transition so local testing remains visually consistent.

Production still requires the restricted nginx/API boundary documented by `record-label/licensing/docs/PRODUCTION_SECURITY_BOUNDARY.md`; adding this route to the public frontend does not make the private Rights Console deployable.
